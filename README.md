## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS


### What I learned
- JS
  - Use 'alert' to ask for warnings rather than 'prompt'
  ```js
  alert("Please select a rating");
  ```


### Continued development
- Do more Frontend Mentor challenges
  - focus on learning more Vanilla JS in the process
  - hopefully become quicker with the HTML & CSS parts
